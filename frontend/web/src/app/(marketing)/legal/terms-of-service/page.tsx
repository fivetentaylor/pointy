        <strong>Fees:</strong> To the extent the Service or any portion thereof
        is made available for any fee, you may be required to select a payment
        plan and provide information regarding your credit card or other payment
        instrument. You represent and warrant to Reviso that such information is
        true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will
        promptly update your account information with Reviso or the Payment
        Processor (as defined below), as applicable, of any changes (for
        example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration
        date) that may occur. You agree to pay Reviso the amount that is
        specified in the payment plan in accordance with the terms of such plan
        and these Terms of Service. If your payment plan includes an ongoing
        subscription that is automatically renewed periodically, you hereby
        authorize Reviso (through the Payment Processor) to bill your payment
        instrument in advance on such periodic basis in accordance with the
        terms of the applicable payment plan until you terminate your account,
        and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred. If you dispute any
        charges you must let Reviso know within sixty (60) days after the date
        that Reviso charges you, or within such longer period of time as may be
        required under applicable law. We reserve the right to change Reviso’s
        prices. If Reviso does change prices, Reviso will provide notice of the
        change through the Service user interface, a pop-up notice, email, or
        through other reasonable means, at Reviso’s option, at least thirty (30)
        days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the
        Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your
        agreement to pay the changed amount. You will be responsible for all
        taxes associated with the Service, other than taxes based on Reviso’s
        net income.
      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        <strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Notwithstanding any amounts owed to
        Reviso hereunder, REVISO DOES NOT PROCESS PAYMENT FOR ANY SERVICES. To

        Processors”). These payment processing services are provided by the
        Payment Processors and are subject to, in the case of Stripe, the Stripe

        Payment Processor’s terms and conditions, privacy policy, and all other
        relevant agreements (collectively, the “Payment Processor Agreements”).
        By agreeing to these Terms of Service, users that use the payment
        functions of the Service also agree to be bound by the applicable
        Payment Processor Agreement for the payment function the user is using,
        as the same may be modified by the applicable Payment Processor from
        time to time. You hereby authorize the applicable Payment Processor to
        store and continue billing your specified payment method even after such
        payment method has expired, to avoid interruptions in payment for your
        use of the Service. Please contact the applicable Payment Processor for
        more information. Reviso assumes no liability or responsibility for any
        payments you make through the Service.

        <strong>Generated Output</strong>: Certain features of the Service
        permit you to provide User Content (including prompts or other input

        <strong>Ownership of Input and Output</strong>: As between you and us,

        subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service and solely to the
        extent we obtain any ownership in any copyrights in your Output, we

      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        <strong>Similarity of Output</strong>: Due to the nature of automated
        content generation, Output may not be unique across users and the
        Service may generate the same or similar output for you, Reviso or a
        third party. Other users may also provide similar Input and receive the
        same or similar Output. Content generated for other users are not
        considered your Output. You hereby irrevocably release, acquit and
        forever discharge, and agree not to sue, Reviso or any of its
        affiliates, or any of their employees, officers, directors or
        representatives with respect to any liability for direct or indirect
        copyright, trademark or other infringement, misappropriation or
        violation of any rights with respect to Output.

        <strong>Accuracy</strong>: Use of the Service may in some situations

        accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case.

        <strong>Limitations of AI-Generated Output</strong>: You acknowledge and
        agree that, in addition to the limitations and restrictions set forth in
        these Terms of Service, there are numerous limitations that apply with
        respect to AI-generated Output due to the fact that it is automatically
        generated, including that (a) it may contain errors or misleading
        information, (b) AI systems are based on predefined rules and algorithms
        that lack the ability to think creatively and come up with new ideas and
        can result in repetitive or formulaic content, (c) AI systems can
        struggle with understanding the nuances of language, including slang,
        idioms, and cultural references, which can result in Output that is out
        of context or does not make sense, (d) AI systems do not have emotions
        and cannot understand or convey emotions in the way humans can, which
        can result in Output that lacks the empathy and emotion that humans are
        able to convey, (e) AI systems can perpetuate biases that are present in
        the data used to train them, which can result in Output that is
        discriminatory or offensive, (f) AI systems can struggle with complex
        tasks that require reasoning, judgment and decision-making, (g) AI
        systems require large amounts of data to train and generate content, and
        the data used to train AI systems may be of poor quality or biased,
        which will negatively impact the accuracy and quality of the generated
        Output, and (h) AI-generated Output can lack the personal touch that
        comes with content created by humans, which can make it seem cold and
        impersonal.

        local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief
        against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms

        or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a

      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        Reviso is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
        efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to
        the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at
        contact@revi.so. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends
        to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a
        written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Reviso should be
        sent to contact@revi.so (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe
        the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the
        specific relief sought. If Reviso and you do not resolve the claim
        within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or
        Reviso may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration,
        the amount of any settlement offer made by Reviso or you will not be
        disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the
        amount, if any, to which you or Reviso is entitled.

        Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with
        the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures,
        including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA
        Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on
        the AAA, please visit its website, https://www.adr.org. Information
        about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the
        AAA’s consumer arbitration page,
        <a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer">
          <u>https://www.adr.org/consumer</u>
        </a>
        . If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and
        any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
        Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that
        the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would
        not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also
        follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All
        issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to
        the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration
        Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
        streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator
        can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a
        court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and
        applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and
        may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        Unless Reviso and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
        take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due
        consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
        circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the
        determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less,
        Reviso agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
        conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator,
        through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established
        by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing
        will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which
        the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned
        written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
        conclusions on which the award is based.

      <p className={pc}>
        <strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>
      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
        (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA
        Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. To the
        extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either
        Reviso or you under the AAA Rules, Reviso and you shall split them
        equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator
        that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration
        Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you
        should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees,
        Reviso will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you
        demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be
        prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Reviso will pay as
        much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to
        prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of
        attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        <strong>Confidentiality</strong>
      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or
        award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit
        of all parties.
      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        <strong>Severability</strong>
      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
        Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled
        “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
        Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace
        such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
        enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
        invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration
        Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the
        arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above
        titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
        Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the
        entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless
        such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with
        respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these
        Terms of Service will continue to apply.

        <strong>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</strong>
      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary,
        Reviso agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration
        Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a
        user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Reviso
        written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the
        Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are
        agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance
        with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first
        accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to
        these Terms of Service).

          <u>Termination</u>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        You agree that Reviso, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate
        your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and
        discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including for
        lack of use or if Reviso believes that you have violated or acted
        inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any
        suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds
        for termination of your use of the Service, may be referred to
        appropriate law enforcement authorities. Reviso may also in its sole
        discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any
        part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of
        your access to the Service under any provision of these Terms of Service
        may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that
        Reviso may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related
        information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to
        such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Reviso will not be
        liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to
        the Service.

          <u>User Disputes</u>

      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any
        other user in connection with the Service, and Reviso will have no
        liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Reviso reserves the
        right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with
        disputes between you and any other user of the Service.

          <u>General</u>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className={pc}>
        These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by
        reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Reviso
        governing your access and use of the Service, and supersede any prior
        agreements between you and Reviso with respect to the Service. You also
        may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when
        you use Third-Party Services, third-party content or third-party
        software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the
        State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With
        respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set
        forth above, you and Reviso submit to the personal and exclusive
        jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New Castle
        County, Delaware. The failure of Reviso to exercise or enforce any right
        or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of
        such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is
        found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
        nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the
        parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
        provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.
        You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
        claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service
        or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such
        claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version
        of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form
        will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon
        or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to
        the same conditions as other business documents and records originally
        generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms
        of Service without the prior written consent of Reviso, but Reviso may
        assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without
        restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for
        convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in
        these Terms of Service, the words “include” and “including,” and
        variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but
        rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”
        Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service
        may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or
        other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the
        Service. Reviso will not be in default hereunder by reason of any
        failure or delay in the performance of its obligations where such
        failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic,
        hostilities, war, terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of
        God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of electrical
        power, network access or equipment, or any other circumstances or causes
        beyond Reviso’s reasonable control.
