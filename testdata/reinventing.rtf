\f2\b0 . We loved the capabilities that LLMs gave to generate content, brainstorm, and research, but we thought the UX was broken in two ways. One, waiting for an LLM to regurgitate my entire document just to make some small changes, like updating the title or fixing some grammar mistakes, is ridiculous. But this is standard practice with LLMs today. Even "revolutionary" products like OpenAI's canvas do this. It's slow, costly, and frustrating. We thought we could do better.\
Second, so many of the generative AI solutions lock the document while the LLM churns through the doc. While the LLM works I can't do anything to my document. Which, in our eyes, was ridiculous. I want to be able to ask the LLM to update paragraph one, while I work on paragraph two.\
