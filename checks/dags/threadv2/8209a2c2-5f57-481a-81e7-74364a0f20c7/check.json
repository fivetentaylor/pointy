To better capture their live sound, the band self-produced Pinkerton, creating a darker, more abrasive album than their 1994 debut Weezer. The lyrics express loneliness and disillusionment with the rock lifestyle, and reference Japanese culture. Pinkerton produced the singles \\\"El Scorcho\\\" and \\\"The Good Life\\\". It debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200, failing to match sales of Weezer's debut, and received mixed reviews; Rolling Stone readers voted it the third-worst album of 1996. For subsequent albums, Weezer returned to more traditional pop songwriting and less personal lyrics.
