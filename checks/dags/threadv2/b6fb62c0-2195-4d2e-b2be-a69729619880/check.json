To better capture their live sound, the band self-produced Pinkerton, creating a darker, more abrasive album than their 1994 debut Weezer. The lyrics express loneliness and disillusionment with the rock lifestyle, and reference Japanese culture. Pinkerton produced the singles \\\"El Scorcho\\\" and \\\"The Good Life\\\". It debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200, failing to match sales of Weezer's debut, and received mixed reviews; Rolling Stone readers voted it the third-worst album of 1996. For subsequent albums, Weezer returned to more traditional pop songwriting and less personal lyrics. In subsequent years, Pinkerton was reassessed; several publications named it one of the best albums of the 1990s, and it was certified platinum in 2016.\",[\"1\",13],1]]],[6,[\"1\",877],[[1,[\"1\",877],[\"1\",3],8],[0,[\"1\",878],\"Pinkerton\\n\",[\"1\",13],-1]]],[6,[\"1\",888],[[1,[\"1\",888],[\"1\",878],10],[8,[\"1\",889],[\"1\",3],8]]],[6,[\"1\",890],[[1,[\"1\",890],[\"1\",3],8],[0,[\"1\",891],\"Pinkerton\",[\"1\",887],1]]],[6,[\"!1\",900],[[2,[\"!1\",900],[\"1\",3],[\"q\",1],{\"e\":\"true\"}],[2,[\"!1\",901],[\"1\",13],[\"1\",13],{}],[2,[\"!1\",902],[\"q\",1],[\"q\",1],{}],[0,[\"!1\",903],\"\\nDespite its initial commercial disappointment and mixed critical reception, Pinkerton has since become a cult classic and is now considered one of Weezer's best works. The album's raw emotion, confessional lyrics, and unconventional production style have been credited with influencing the emo genre's development in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Many artists, including Manchester Orchestra, The Promise Ring, and The Get Up Kids, have cited Pinkerton as a significant influence on their music. The album's reappraisal has led to numerous reissues, including a deluxe edition in 2010 featuring B-sides and live performances, further cementing its status as a pivotal album in alternative rock history.\",[\"1\",876],1],[2,[\"!1\",1608],[\"1\",13],[\"1\",13],{\"h\":\"1\"}]]],[6,[\"!1\",1609],[[2,[\"!1\",1609],[\"1\",3],[\"q\",1],{\"e\":\"true\"}],[2,[\"!1\",1610],[\"1\",13],[\"1\",13],{}],[2,[\"!1\",1611],[\"q\",1],[\"q\",1],{}],[1,[\"!1\",1612],[\"!1\",904],20],[0,[\"!1\",1613],\"From \",[\"!1\",904],-1],[1,[\"!1\",1618],[\"!1\",935],55],[0,[\"!1\",1619],\"flop to revered masterpiece, Pinkerton's journey \",[\"!1\",935],-1],[1,[\"!1\",1668],[\"!1\",994],13],[0,[\"!1\",1669],\"been nothing short of extraordinary, evolving into \",[\"!1\",994],-1],[1,[\"!1\",1720],[\"!1\",1026],18],[0,[\"!1\",1721],\"securing its place as \",[\"!1\",1026],-1],[1,[\"!1\",1743],[\"!1\",1060],5],[0,[\"!1\",1744],\"most celebrated \",[\"!1\",1060],-1],[2,[\"!1\",1760],[\"1\",13],[\"1\",13],{\"h\":\"1\"}]]],[6,[\"!1\",1761],[[2,[\"!1\",1761],[\"1\",3],[\"q\",1],{\"e\":\"true\"}],[2,[\"!1\",1762],[\"1\",13],[\"1\",13],{}],[2,[\"!1\",1763],[\"q\",1],[\"q\",1],{}],[0,[\"!1\",1764],\"Musically, Pinkerton marks a departure from the polished power pop of Weezer's debut album. The record showcases a grittier, more aggressive sound with distorted guitars, dynamic rhythms, and raw, emotional vocals from frontman Rivers Cuomo. Songs like \\\"Tired of Sex,\\\" \\\"Across the Sea,\\\" and \\\"Butterfly\\\" delve into themes of sexual frustration, longing, and regret, often drawing inspiration from Cuomo's experiences and his fascination with Japanese culture. The album's production, handled by the band themselves, emphasizes a live-in-studio feel, eschewing the more refined approach of their previous work. This unfiltered sound, combined with Cuomo's confessional and often uncomfortable lyrics, creates an intimate and intense listening experience that has resonated with fans and critics alike over the years.\\n\",[\"!1\",1613],-1],[2,[\"!1\",2579],[\"1\",13],[\"1\",13],{\"h\":\"1\"}]]],[6,[\"!1\",2580],[[0,[\"!1\",2580],\"album was recorded at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys and Fort Apache Studios in Boston, with the band taking a more hands-on approach to the production process.

The album's centerpiece, \\\"The Good Life,\\\" is a catchy yet introspective track that reflects on Cuomo's desire to return to a simpler life after experiencing the pressures of fame.\\nPinkerton's influence extends beyond its musical content. The album's DIY production aesthetic and unvarnished lyrical honesty have inspired countless indie and alternative rock bands to embrace a more authentic and personal approach to songwriting. Its exploration of themes such as isolation, sexual frustration, and cultural displacement resonated strongly with a generation of listeners, particularly those who felt alienated by the mainstream rock scene of the mid-1990s.\\nThe album's journey from commercial disappointment to critical darling has made it a case study in the music industry, highlighting the sometimes stark divide between initial reception and long-term impact. Pinkerton's rehabilitation in the eyes of critics and fans alike has led to numerous retrospectives and analyses, with music journalists and academics exploring the reasons behind its initial failure and subsequent rise to cult status.\\nIn the years following Pinkerton's release, Weezer's relationship with the album has been complex. Initially distancing themselves from its raw sound and personal lyrics, the band gradually came to embrace Pinkerton's legacy. This acceptance culminated in a series of \\\"Memories\\\" tours in 2010 and 2011, where Weezer performed the album in its entirety, much to the delight of longtime fans.\\nToday, Pinkerton stands as a testament to the power of artistic integrity and the unpredictable nature of musical legacies. Its journey from misunderstood sophomore effort to influential classic serves as an inspiration to artists facing critical or commercial setbacks, reminding them that true artistic value often transcends immediate reception. As Weezer continues to evolve and release new music, Pinkerton remains a touchstone in their discography, a bold and uncompromising work that continues to captivate and inspire listeners more than two decades after its initial release.\",[\"!1\",1607],1],[2,[\"!1\",6989],[\"1\",13],[\"1\",13],{\"h\":\"1\"}]]],[6,[\"check\",6990],[[2,[\"check\",6990],[\"1\",3],[\"q\",1],{\"e\":\"true\"}],[2,[\"check\",6991],[\"1\",13],[\"1\",13],{}],[2,[\"check\",6992],[\"q\",1],[\"q\",1],{}],[1,[\"check\",6993],[\"1\",285],8],[0,[\"check\",6994],\"explode with raw emotion, painting a vivid picture of \",[\"1\",285],-1],[1,[\"check\",7048],[\"1\",349],14],[0,[\"check\",7049],\"while weaving in fascinating threads of \",[\"1\",349],-1],[1,[\"check\",7089],[\"!1\",2877],10],[0,[\"check\",7090],\"the mastermind behind \",[\"!1\",2877],-1],[0,[\"check\",7112],\"soul-searching \",[\"!1\",2943],-1],[1,[\"check\",7127],[\"!1\",3008],12],[0,[\"check\",7128],\"obsession \",[\"!1\",3008],-1],[0,[\"check\",7138],\"heart-wrenching \",[\"!1\",3047],-1],[1,[\"check\",7154],[\"!1\",3088],11],[0,[\"check\",7155],\"burns bright \",[\"!1\",3088],-1],[1,[\"check\",7168],[\"!1\",3102],6],[0,[\"check\",7169],\"tracks \",[\"!1\",3102],-1],[0,[\"check\",7176],\"the haunting \",[\"!1\",3113],-1],[0,[\"check\",7189],\"even \",[\"!1\",3134],-1],[0,[\"check\",7194],\"boldly \",[\"!1\",3159],-1],[1,[\"check\",7201],[\"!1\",3191],6],[0,[\"check\",7202],\"opera, adding layers of depth to the already complex musical tapestry.\",[\"!1\",3191],-1],[2,[\"check\",7272],[\"1\",13],[\"1\",13],{\"h\":\"1\"}]]]]}",
